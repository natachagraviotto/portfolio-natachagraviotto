            Then, I applied styles using CSS to give the calculator an attractive look and feel. I customized the colors, fonts and layouts to make it look nice. I also added styles to the buttons to highlight the hover effect and provide visual feedback to the user.
            
            In JavaScript, I captured the button events and handled the calculation logic. I implemented functions to perform the mathematical operations, validate user input and update the screen with the results. In addition, I added functionality such as the delete button and the equals button.
